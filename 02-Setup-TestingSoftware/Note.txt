* Adjust the Development Environment :
==> Testing Setup : - application setup & code
                    - Generally independent setup
                    - All you need for manual testing
                    - it can (and typically will) be integrated
                    - e.g. , based on webpack , Vite , ...
                    - Automated tests : = Test Runner :
                                          . Runs your tests (i.e., the testing code)
                                          . Automatically detects testing code
                                          . displays result
                                          . e.g., Jest, Karma
                                        + Assertion Library :
                                          . used to define expected outcomes
                                          . checks whether expectations are met
                                          . Supports all kinds of expectations and modes (sync / async)
                                          . e.g., Jest, Chai
